###Godot's Plugin System

Godot supports extensibility via its plugin system which, like the core project, includes various modules developed by the community. While The Godot Project maintains its own
official Asset Library, the editor supports the use of any plugin that conforms to their specifications and can be installed by users manually. One powerful feature of Godot's
plugin system is that plugins do not need to be compiled or written in a standalone programming language, and can be built using the editor, written in GDScript, Godot's
proprietary scripting language. In fact, the Editor allows you to create plugins much like it supports the creation of scenes and other assets, featuring its own menu
for doing so. This robust support for plugins demonstrates the project's commitment to ensuring high configurability by end-users, a subject discussed in our previous essay. For this deeper
analysis, we will start with discussion what specific enhancements are supported by the plugin system.
